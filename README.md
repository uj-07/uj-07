# Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>
I'm Udishi, an AI & ML undergrad from India . <br> 

I try to build stuff that mix creativity + impact. <br> 

My main tech stack is Python, FastAPI, MySQL, opencv, keras, streamlit <br> 

If an idea excites me, I usually end up building it (or at least trying to 😄).<br> 

I am currently mastering Reinforcement Learning by training AI agents and working on decoding neural data from MEG signals<br>


## Fun Fact:

- I am an alien from Trappist-1e.<br>
- I know how to make art.<br>
- I am in love with the idea of AGI.<br>
- I am currently learning neuroscience.

Got a cool thought about tech, space and science? Slide in, I’m curious 👀✨
